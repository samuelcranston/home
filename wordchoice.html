<h1>Word Choice</h1>
<p>
I write my poem you write your crossword </br>
Our pointy pencils press on paper,</br>
“Howdy”</br>
Of course that’s the answer to line 5 Across: <i>Cowboy’s Greeting</i></br>
Just the wrong way to start a conversation</br>
Sometimes I wish I were a cowboy</br>
They don’t have much need for paper</br>
They are masters of dialogue and</br>
37. Down: <i>Lights Camera</i> ______</br>
With one flash,</br>
They command the audiences attention</br>
Stupefied</br>
Coffee dribbles down my face</br>
And I quickly wipe it up with a paper napkin</br>
20 Across: <i>Rorschach Test</i></br>
I don’t remember why you stopped going to therapy</br>
I suppose talking can be hard</br>
I can never get through to you these days</br>
Maybe it would be better if I were like your crossword</br>
But despite the point of my pencil</br>
I’ve run out of words</br>
