<h1>Poems</h1>
<p>
Things aren’t where they should be </br>
A house is an interruption,</br>
but these bumps on the ground</br>
magnify the sky</br>
The navy sheet drapes around them</br>
like an attic cloth</br>
Which covers that American nightmare</br>
swaddles it, a wretched forgotten thing</br>
a memory, even to</br>
those who first conceived it</br>
 </br>
I’ve always thought of those</br>
Who moved out west</br>
That they didn’t want more land</br>
But wanted to more clearly</br>
gaze into the American blanket </br>
And go mad from desire</br>
While they are suffocated in cotton</br>
 </br>
But the sky predates them</br>
It has ancient charm</br>
It feels “eastern” “western” “upwards” and “downwards”</br>
It is accompanied by a simple string quartet</br>
In the corner of an old church</br>
Yet touches all corners of the earth</br>
Our sky is obviously mystical</br>
A fiddle tune can’t do it justice</br>
 </br>
But it has always been</br>
Our human touch</br>
That stretches and pulls on the canvas</br>
And paints the sky with many hues</br>
That’s why when you see truthfully the single blue</br>
Everything is erased</br>
The night sky is alive with stars</br>
That sea of blue is but a reflection
