<h1>Opposite Day</h1>
<p>
There was a man who lived opposite the cemetery </br>
But he was never morbid</br>
For he lived opposite to it</br>
he did the opposite of what those at the cemetery did</br>
He never laid down, or touched soil</br>
But he still had turmoil</br>
 </br>
Those at the cemetery </br>
felt nothing at all</br>
He felt everything</br>
Those at the cemetery </br>
didn’t fear his house</br>
Like he feared theirs</br>
 </br>
He needn’t be so opposite</br>
The cemetery will never house him</br>
A cemetery accepts all emotions </br>
He rejects them proudly</br>
He chose to live opposite of the cemetery </br>
Because he likes the view</br>
The cemetery chose to be here</br>
Because it couldn’t choose
